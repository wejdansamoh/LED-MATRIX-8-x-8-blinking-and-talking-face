Creating a simulation of a face talking and blinking on an 8x8 LED matrix with an Arduino Uno involves defining several patterns for the face with different mouth and eye states. We will use the LedControl library to control the MAX7219 module.


Components Needed:

Arduino Uno

MAX7219 module (controlling an 8x8 matrix)

Jumper wires
